Machine Learning Project

Supervised and Unsupervised learning
1. Introduction:
   
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed. This project demonstrates both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques using a simple dataset.

2. Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to apply one supervised learning algorithm and one unsupervised learning algorithm on a simple dataset to understand data preprocessing, model training, evaluation and visualization.

3. Dataset Description:

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with four features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. The dataset classifies flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

4. Tools and Technologies Used:

•	Programming Language: Python
•	Environment: Google Colab
•	Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
•	Supervised Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
•	Unsupervised Algorithm: K-Means Clustering

5. Methodology / Approach:

•	Load the dataset using Scikit-learn.
•	Perform data preprocessing and feature scaling.
•	Split dataset into training and testing sets.
•	Train KNN classifier and evaluate using accuracy and confusion matrix.
•	Apply K-Means clustering to group similar data points.
•	Use PCA for visualization of clusters.

6. Results:

The supervised learning model (KNN) achieved high classification accuracy. The unsupervised learning model (K-Means) successfully grouped similar data points into three clusters corresponding to flower species.

7. Conclusion:

This project successfully demonstrated the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data for prediction, while unsupervised learning identifies hidden patterns without labels.
